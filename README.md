### I am D1sturbed

***

I do a lot of things, mainly for the Atlas Institute.

Other than that, I enjoy IT Security, and adminstrate Several Communication/Filesharing/Anonymising servers fpr the Atlas Institute

- I'm currently working on containerising The Atlas Institute's Communications Servers for better efficiency and scalability
- I'm always getting better at Assembler C/C++ and Python
- I Love hardware hacking and low level programming
- Find me on The Atlas Institute's XMPP Server, on Liberachat's IRC Server, or find my email address, and send me a PGP encrypted email
