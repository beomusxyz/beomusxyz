### I'm Beomus

I'm a student, staunch privacy advocate, Free Software enthusiast, and a questionably competent programmer... 

I run a site, called [The Corporia](https://thecorporia.org). There, I host a few privacy respecting services, including but not limited to, an XMPP server, Jitsi instance, Cgit and Gitea instances (just in case i can't use github anymore), and a calibre server. 

The XMPP server is currently open for registration, so just sign up with your preferred client and i guess i'll see you there!
